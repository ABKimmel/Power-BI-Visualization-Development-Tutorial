#Power BI Custom Visualization Tutorial
---
This repo aims to provide a more complete tutorial on creating custom visualizations for Power BI than what is provided by the official documentation. There is a [step-by-step tutorial](/docs/project.md) that will walk you through creating a pie chart. The source code for that pie chart will be available in the [SamplePieChart]() folder. There are also other visualizations under the [TableDemo](), and [SingleDemo]() folders. These are not fully featured visualizations, and are only intended to demonstrate topics covered in the [appendices](/docs/project.md#Appendices) section of the documentation.

If you have any questions or find an error, please open an issue. I will try to answer questions and fix errors as soon as I can. If you want to elaborate on something, feel free to open a pull request, and I will review it as soon as I can.
